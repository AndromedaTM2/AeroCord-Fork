# CURRENTLY UNSTABLE⚠️
## Discords new module updates have caused this theme to not work anymore. Discord keeps redesigning their UI so there's no telling when this theme will and won't work.
# AeroCord Theme
A very clean looking, messily coded Discord Theme. Specifically edited in [Vesktop on linux mint](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)


## 🔧 Simple Installation:
- Download and Install Vesktop: [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)
- Download AeroCord.css: [Latest AeroCord File](https://github.com/Twisty10000/AeroCord/blob/main/AeroCord.css)
- Navigate to Discord Settings -> Vencord -> Themes -> Open Themes Folder -> Paste AeroCord.css into the directory -> Back to vencord, load missing and activate!
