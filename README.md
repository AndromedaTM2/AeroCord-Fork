# CURRENTLY UNSTABLE⚠️
## Discords new module updates have caused this theme to not work anymore. Discord keeps redesigning their UI so there's no telling when this theme will and won't work.
# AeroCord Theme
A very clean looking, messily coded Discord Theme. Specifically edited in [Vesktop on linux mint](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)


## 🔧 Simple Installation:
- Download and Install Vesktop: [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop)
- Download AeroCord.css: [Latest AeroCord File](https://github.com/Twisty10000/AeroCord/blob/main/AeroCord.css)
- Navigate to Discord Settings -> Vencord -> Themes -> Open Themes Folder -> Paste AeroCord.css into the directory -> Back to vencord, load missing and activate!
- Enjoy!

*For best looking buttons change your base appearance to ash.

I really liked the idea of this theme but it had some issues I wanted ironed out. Not sure if I’ll do more with this but in case I feel like it or someone else does here are some things the theme still needs fixed. 

1. At least for me the buttons in a dm (such as calling a friend) are horribly small.
2. The left hand bar of a server needs made transparent.
3. a lot of the buttons seem dim/dark.
4. settings page and activities bar need transparent.
