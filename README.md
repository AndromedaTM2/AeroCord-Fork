![Image 4](https://github.com/Twisty10000/AeroCord/blob/main/Images/NewButtons.png?raw=true)
Fixed Buttons with better coloring and scale.

Also fixed the activities page, would take a picture but eh.

Also! Changed the url from the nextcloud host to using github to host the url. Not sure if we have a better option but at least on vesktop the nextcloud url is getting blocked and the theme doesn't work :c. maybe a local hosting?
